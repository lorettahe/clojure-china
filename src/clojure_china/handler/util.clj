#_(defmacro with-validations
  "triggers a validation before evaluating 'body', if the validation fails, throws an InvalidPlayerOperation.
   param 'vs' should be a binding of a pred and an error message (in string or hash-map), e.g:
     (defn cost-money [pid cost-amount]
       (let [money (get-money pid)]
         (with-validations
           [(< money cost-amount) \"not enough money\"
            (wallet-locked? pid)   \"your wallet is locked\"]
         ;; the function that actually costs money, without checking
         (cost-money* pid cost-amount))))

   Remind that due to 'InvalidPlayerOperation' being an exception,
     when 'InvalidPlayerOperation' raises, the 'with-validations' short-circuits its follow-up operations even out of the scope"
